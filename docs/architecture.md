# NexChain Architecture Overview

## Introduction
NexChain is a high-performance blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This document provides an overview of the system architecture, including its components and interactions.

## Key Components
- **Consensus Layer**: Implements various consensus mechanisms (e.g., DPoS, BFT) to ensure network security and transaction validation.
- **Networking Layer**: Manages peer-to-peer communication and remote procedure calls (RPC) for data exchange between nodes.
- **Blockchain Layer**: Responsible for maintaining the blockchain, including block creation, transaction processing, and ledger management.
- **Smart Contract Layer**: Provides a framework for developing, deploying, and executing smart contracts.
- **Security Layer**: Implements security features such as decentralized identity management and zero-knowledge proofs.

## System Flow
1. **Transaction Creation**: Users create transactions through dApps.
2. **Transaction Propagation**: Transactions are propagated through the network.
3. **Consensus**: Nodes validate transactions using the consensus mechanism.
4. **Block Creation**: Validated transactions are grouped into blocks.
5. **Blockchain Update**: The blockchain is updated with the new block.

## Conclusion
The architecture of NexChain is designed for scalability, security, and flexibility, enabling developers to build robust decentralized applications.
